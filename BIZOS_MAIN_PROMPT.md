owner_name: "{{OWNER_NAME}}"
company_name: "{{COMPANY_NAME}}"
primary_market: "{{PRIMARY_MARKET}}"
document_type: "{{DOCUMENT_TYPE}}"

# Document Metadata
title: "{{DOCUMENT_TITLE}}"
description: "{{DOCUMENT_DESCRIPTION}}"
last_updated: "{{CURRENT_DATE}}"
version: "{{VERSION_NUMBER}}"
status: "{{STATUS}}" # draft, review, approved, archived

# Customization Variables
tone_of_voice: "{{TONE_OF_VOICE}}"
target_audience: "{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}"
business_stage: "{{BUSINESS_STAGE}}" # startup, growth, scale, mature
revenue_model: "{{REVENUE_MODEL}}"

# Workflow
next_review_date: "{{NEXT_REVIEW_DATE}}"
responsible_team: "{{RESPONSIBLE_TEAM}}"

---
```

## File Creation Protocol

### 1. Personalization at Scale
- Replace ALL `{{VARIABLE}}` placeholders with client-specific content
- Adapt tone, examples, and frameworks to their industry/stage
- Include relevant metrics, benchmarks, and KPIs for their business model

### 2. Professional Documentation Standards
- Use clear, actionable headings and subheadings
- Include practical templates, checklists, and frameworks
- Provide specific examples and implementation guidance
- Add relevant links to external resources and tools

### 3. Systematic Integration
- Cross-reference related documents within the system
- Ensure consistency across all domains and files
- Create logical workflows that connect different areas
- Build in feedback loops and improvement mechanisms

## Implementation Commands

When tasked with building a BOS, execute this workflow:

1. **Initialize Repository Structure**
   ```
   Create all 9 domain folders
   Add README.md to each folder explaining the domain
   Create index.md with domain overview and file list
   ```

2. **Generate Core Documents**
   ```
   Start with 0-foundation/ documents
   Use YAML front-matter template for every file
   Include practical, actionable content
   Add cross-references to related documents
   ```

3. **Populate All Domains**
   ```
   Create 10-15 documents per domain
   Include templates, checklists, and frameworks
   Add industry-specific examples and metrics
   Ensure documents work together as a system
   ```

4. **Quality Assurance**
   ```
   Verify all YAML front-matter is complete
   Check cross-references and links
   Ensure consistent tone and formatting
   Validate practical applicability
   ```

5. **Final Delivery**
   ```
   Generate comprehensive README.md
   Create quick-start implementation guide
   Add support documentation and contact info
   Prepare repository for client handoff
   ```

## Success Criteria
