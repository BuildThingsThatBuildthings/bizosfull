# Mission, Vision & Values Framework

## Foundational Belief

*What do we believe to be true about the universe and our place in it?*

Because we believe {{foundational_belief}}, we therefore must {{organizational_imperative}}.

---

## Vision

*The future state we aim to create.*

```
Vision: {{vision_statement}}
```

---

## Mission

*What we do and why it matters — one concise sentence.*

```
Mission: {{mission_statement}}
```

---

## Core Values

*3–5 guiding principles that shape every decision.*

| # | Value | Definition / Behavior Example |
|---|-------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | {{value_1_name}} | {{value_1_definition}} |
| 2 | {{value_2_name}} | {{value_2_definition}} |
| 3 | {{value_3_name}} | {{value_3_definition}} |
| 4 | {{value_4_name}} | {{value_4_definition}} |
| 5 | {{value_5_name}} | {{value_5_definition}} |

## Application in Practice

### Decision-Making Filter
When facing tough choices, ask:
1. Does this align with our foundational belief about {{foundational_belief}}?
2. Does this move us closer to our vision of {{vision_statement}}?
3. Does this support our mission to {{mission_statement}}?
4. Which of our core values does this decision honor or challenge?

### Communication Guidelines

- **External**: Ensure all marketing and customer interactions reflect our mission and values
- **Hiring**: Evaluate candidates based on alignment with our core values
